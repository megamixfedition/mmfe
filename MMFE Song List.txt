MMFE SONG LIST PREVIEW: (it can be changed in the future) 

There will be songs that will not have technical zone, because they never work as they sould. I have
been working on technical zone for ghost rule for almost a week, and nothing.. The techzone starts
on the right time, but on the final of it, it ends 3 notes earlier, and it gets success, i don't
know how to explain, but that's it.. The songs that will not have technical zones (for now) will 
be marker on the list bellow as "NO TECHZONE".

Currently improving some PVs, and fixing small issues, after that success events will be created.
Stages/Character lighting on All PVs are done, and early charts fixed (NEW).

MMFE was tested on PS3, few lag only in some AFT/AC songs, most of dreamy theather songs works without any 
issues on PS3, after RPCS3 version be finished, PS3 will be done after being optimized, after 
that, we will work on Vita version.

Recent issue: "LOVE IS WAR" and "melody..." lags on PS3 for some strange reason.

Working on Technical Zones for all songs.
Working on Reversible Campaign charts.
Waiting for Ray motion to make the rendered video.
