MMFE SONG LIST PREVIEW: (it can be changed in the future) 

BIG NEW! Once all failed and success scenes are done, MMFE will be released for RPCS3 version!


-Every new change will be marked as "(NEW)" on the list below.

-Working on Success/Fail Scenes.
-Working on new Intro Movie for MMFE.
-Fixing/Updating some MMFE Sprites.
-PDX/F2nd Modules are being ported.
-Hibikase restored!

Reminding PS3/VITA version will be a downgraded version of RPCS3:
  |-The resolution will be limited to 720p (PS3)
  |_FXAA will be disabled (PS3)
  
 -I know that using 720p will not change the internal resolution on the game, but just to be safe
we will make it run at 720p. (PS3 Version).

 -VITA version will be probably the easiest one (at some point) to get optimized stuff, because the
resolution and shaders that it uses are really "light"...

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 -MMFE was tested on PS3, there's few lag only in some AFT/AC songs, most of dreamy theather songs works without any 
issues on PS3, after RPCS3 version be finished, we will work on PS3 version (by optimizing on it), and after that,
we will work on the vita version.

Recent issues: "LOVE IS WAR" and "melody..." lags on PS3 for some strange reason.
