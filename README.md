# MEGAMIX -F Edition-
This page will be used for releases/updates for Project DIVA MEGAMIX -F Edition-. This mod is about having AFT/FT and MEGA39s songs ported into Project DIVA F! It will have new modules (edited too, so they can fit PDF style), actual redesigned charts ~~with technical zones~~\*, and chance time events for almost all songs, unfortunately there will not be long notes, since the only way to add them is writing them manually. They could be added with a converter (converting slidechains to long notes), but they get out of sync.<br>There will also be new menu graphics, new sprites, you will be able to use DIVA Room and Edit Mode using brand new modules and stages!

It will be available on PS3, RPCS3 and PS Vita! But there will be some differences between those plataforms. Depending on your PC, RPCS3 can be a lot more powerful than PS3, so it will be able to handle the mod better, with better quality textures, stages and all. PS3 and PS Vita will have decreased graphics (Specially Vita).

# Important Information
- MMFE takes up 10GB of space
- If you are playing MMFE on RPCS3, delete all Vanilla F cache, and you have to create a new save data, and vice-versa, otherwise it will crash.
- If you are playing MMFE on PS3, just create a new save data and everything should be just fine, not forgetting that MMFE is not optimized for PS3
yet, so you might have issues, like loop loadings or random crashes.

# FAQ
### What's the difference between PS3 and RPCS3?
* RPCS3 version is heavier because of the better quality graphics. You can use RPCS3 version in PS3 and vice versa, but may cause lag.
### How do I install this game?
You'll first need a modded PS Vita, PS3 or a PC able to run RPCS3.
- RPCS3:<br>
    Simply drop the EBOOT.bin (Location: "BLUS31319 > PS3_GAME > USRDIR")
- PS Vita:<br>
    Transfer the .vpk file over to your Vita. Open vitashell, press X on the vpk then X wherever it asks you if you want to install it.<br>
- PS3: <br>
    Download the BLUS31319 folder copy it to a USB Drive, (it needs atleast 16GB of space) after that, open multiman on your PS3, if you
    don't have it, please install it, copy the BLUS31319 folder wherever you want, at your choice and after it's completely copied, open the
    it in the next folders "BLUS31319 > PS3_GAME > USRDIR" and double click or double select the EBOOT.bin inside that folder. Multiman should
    automatically and make the game appear on the playstation menu where you open the games.
### Do you plan to make this mod in X or F2nd in the future?
* No. That's not planned as of now.
