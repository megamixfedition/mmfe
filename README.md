# MEGAMIX -F Edition-
This page will be used for releases/updates for Project DIVA MEGAMIX -F Edition-. This mod is about having AFT/FT and MEGA39s songs ported into Project DIVA F! It will have new modules (edited too, so they can fit PDF style), actual redesigned charts ~~with technical zones~~\*, and chance time events for almost all songs, unfortunately there will not be long notes, since the only way to add them is writing them manually. They could be added with a converter (converting slidechains to long notes), but they get out of sync.<br>There will also be new menu graphics, new sprites, you will be able to use DIVA Room and Edit Mode using brand new modules and stages!

It will be available on PS3, RPCS3 and PS Vita! But there will be some differences between those plataforms. Depending on your PC, RPCS3 can be a lot more powerful than PS3, so it will be able to handle the mod better, with better quality textures, stages and all. PS3 and PS Vita will have decreased graphics (Specially Vita).

# Important Information
- MMFE takes up 10GB of space
- If you are playing MMFE on RPCS3, delete all Vanilla F cache, and you have to create a new save data, and vice-versa, otherwise it will crash.
- If you are playing MMFE on PS3, just create a new save data and everything should be just fine, the game uses a new ID for the folder and you can install it without the need to replace other vanilla F game.
