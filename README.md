# MEGAMIX -F Edition-
This page will be used for releases/updates for Project DIVA MEGAMIX -F Edition-. This mod is about having AFT/FT and MEGA39s songs ported into Project DIVA F! It will have new modules (edited too, so they can fit PDF style), actual redesigned charts ~~with technical zones~~\*, and chance time events for all songs, unfortunately there will not be long notes, since the only way to add them is writing them manually. They could be added with a converter (converting slidechains to long notes), but they get out of sync.<br>There will also be new menu graphics, new sprites, you will be able to use DIVA Room and Edit Mode using brand new modules and stages!

It will be available on PS3, RPCS3 and PS Vita! But there will be some differences between those plataforms. Depending on your PC, RPCS3 can be a lot more powerful than PS3, so it will be able to handle the mod better, with better quality textures, stages and all. PS3 and PS Vita will have decreased graphics (Specially Vita).

# FAQ
### What's the difference between PS3 and RPCS3?
* RPCS3 version is heavier because of the better quality graphics. You can use RPCS3 version in PS3 and vice versa, but may cause lag.
### How do I install this game?
You'll first need a modded PS Vita, PS3 or a PC able to run RPCS3.
- RPCS3:<br>
    Simply drop the .pkg file onto RPCS3 window after following the RPCS3 setup.
- PS Vita:<br>
    Transfer the .vpk file over to your Vita. Open vitashell, press X on the vpk then X wherever it asks you if you want to install it.<br>
- PS3: <br>
    First start by copying the .pkg file(s) to a Flash Drive formatted as FAT32, then plug it into your PS3.<br>
    Enable HEN, and there will be a folder called "Package Manager" on the XMB menu. Open it.<br>
    Open the "Install PKG Files" folder inside it, then open the "Standard" folder and finally install the pkg. The game should be on the XMB menu now.
### Do you plan to make this mod in X or F2nd in the future?
* No. That's not planned as of now.
### Please! Make the sticks work as star input on Vita!
* Use the [reVita config by Derpy](https://discord.com/channels/655202295067443221/655202295067443224/779164346634338354)
